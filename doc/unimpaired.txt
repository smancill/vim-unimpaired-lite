INTRODUCTION                                    *unimpaired*

This plugin provides several pairs of bracket maps.

NEXT AND PREVIOUS                               *unimpaired-next*

The following maps all correspond to normal mode commands.  If a count is
given, it becomes an argument to the command.  A mnemonic for the "a" commands
is "args" and for the "q" commands is "quickfix".

*[a*     |:previous|
*]a*     |:next|
*[A*     |:first|
*]A*     |:last|
*[b*     |:bprevious|
*]b*     |:bnext|
*[B*     |:bfirst|
*]B*     |:blast|
*[l*     |:lprevious|
*]l*     |:lnext|
*[L*     |:lfirst|
*]L*     |:llast|
*[q*     |:cprevious|
*]q*     |:cnext|
*[Q*     |:cfirst|
*]Q*     |:clast|
*[t*     |:tprevious|
*]t*     |:tnext|
*[T*     |:tfirst|
*]T*     |:tlast|
